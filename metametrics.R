# Next, I plot the distribution of test scores and compute metrics that will be helpful
# for evaluating test items. These include the item difficulty, discrimination, and Cronbach's
# alpha. In practical terms, in order to create a better test, we would consider replacing items
# with excessive difficulty or low discrimination. Meanwhile, Cronbach's alpha serves as a
# measure of the test's internal consistency. For a larger test, further steps could include
# factor analysis to confirm that the dimensionality of the test matches its intention.
